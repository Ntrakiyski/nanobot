# Nanobot - Build MCP Agents

Nanobot enables building agents with MCP and MCP-UI by providing a flexible MCP host.
While existing applications like VSCode, Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT, and Goose all include an MCP host,
Nanobot is designed to be a standalone, open-source MCP host that can be easily deployed or integrated into
your applications. You can use Nanobot to create your own dedicated MCP and MCP-UI powered chatbot.

## What is an MCP Host?

An [MCP host](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/architecture/index#host) is
the service that combines MCP servers with an LLM and context to present an agent experience to a
consumer. The primary experience today is a chat interface, but it can be many other interfaces such
as voice, SMS, e-mail, AR/VR, Slack, MCP, or any other interface that can be used to interact with
an agent.

## Examples

Here are some examples of Nanobots in action:
- [Blackjack Game](https://blackjack.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/blackjack.yaml) [(mcp source)](https://github.com/nanobot-ai/blackjack)
- [Hugging Face MCP](https://huggingface.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/huggingface.yaml)
- [Shopping/Shopify](https://shopping.nanobot.ai) [(config)](./examples/shopping.yaml)

## Installation

Nanobot can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install nanobot-ai/tap/nanobot
```

This will give you the `nanobot` CLI, which you can use to run and manage your MCP host.

---

## Getting Started

---

## Configuration

Nanobot supports the following providers:

- **OpenAI** (e.g. `gpt-4`)
- **Anthropic** (e.g. `claude-3`)

To use them, set the corresponding API key:

```bash
# For OpenAI models
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# For Anthropic models
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Nanobot automatically selects the correct provider based on the model specified.

---

Create a configuration file (e.g. `nanobot.yaml`) that defines your agents and MCP servers.

**Example:**

```yaml
agents:
  dealer:
    name: Blackjack Dealer
    model: gpt-4.1
    mcpServers: blackjackmcp

mcpServers:
  blackjackmcp:
    url: https://blackjack.nanobot.ai/mcp
```

Start Nanobot with:

```bash
nanobot run ./nanobot.yaml
```

The UI will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

---

## Development & Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Nanobot is still in **alpha**, so expect active development and rapid changes.

### Build from Source

```bash
make
```

### Working on the UI

The Nanobot UI lives in the `./ui` directory. To develop against it:

1. Remove the old build artifacts:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ./ui/dist
   ```

2. Rebuild the Nanobot binary:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Start the UI in development mode:

   ```bash
   cd ui
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The UI must be served from port **5173**.\
   Nanobot runs on port **8080** and will forward UI requests to `:5173`.

---

## Features & Roadmap

Nanobot aims to be a **fully compliant MCP Host** and support all MCP + MCP-UI features.

## Notes

This documentation is based on the current Nanobot framework architecture and provides comprehensive coverage of multi-client AI agent deployment. The framework is designed to be lightweight and leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for extensibility. Key features include profile-based configuration management, secure credential handling, and flexible deployment options supporting both stdio and HTTP-based MCP servers.

The configuration system supports inheritance through the `extends` mechanism and profile-based overrides for different environments. Environment variable substitution provides flexibility in configuration management, while the logging system offers comprehensive debugging and monitoring capabilities.

For production deployments, consider implementing proper monitoring, backup strategies, and security measures as outlined in this guide. The framework's modular design allows for easy scaling and customization based on specific requirements.
